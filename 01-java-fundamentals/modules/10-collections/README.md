<h1 align=center>Module 10: Collections</h1>

<h2 align=center>Module Purpose</h2>
The purpose of this module is to teach learners how to store and mange **groups of objects** using collections.

So far, arrays have allowed programs to store multiple values, but arrays have fixed sizes. Collections like `ArrayList` provide flexible, dynamic storage that can grow and shrink as needed.

Collections are essential for building real applications where the amount of data changes over time — such as inventories, party members, enemies, or shopping carts.

<h2 align=center>Learning Goals</h2>

By the end of this module, learners should understand:
- What a collection is
- How `ArrayList` differs from arrays
- How to add, remove, and access elements in an `ArrayList`
- How to loop through a collection
- How to store objects inside collections

---

<h2 align=center>Skills You Will Gain</h2>

After completing this module, learners will be able to:
- Create and use an `ArrayList`
- Dynamically add and remove elements
- Access elements by index
- Loop through collections to process data
- Store custom objects in a collection

<h2 align=center>Module Summary</h2>

This module introduced collections, allowing programs to store and manage **dynamic groups of data**.

You can now:
- Use `ArrayList` instead of fixed-sized arrays
- Add and remove items dynamically
- Store custom objects in collections
- Loop through collections to process data

With collections mastered, you're read to explore **formatting and advanced output**, where program display data clearly and professionally.
