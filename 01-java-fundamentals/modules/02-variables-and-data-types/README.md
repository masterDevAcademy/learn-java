<h1 align=center>Module 02: Variables & Data Types</h1>

<h2 align=center>Module Purpose</h2>

The purpose of this module is to introduce learners to **how Java stores information**, **represents different kinds of data**, and **accepts input from users**.

In Module 01, programs were static — they printed exactly what was written in the code.

In this module, programs become **dynamic**.

Learners will begin using **variables** to store values, **data types** to represent kinds of information, and **user input** to make programs interactive. By the end of this module, learners should understand how data flows **into**, **through**, and **out of** a Java program.

This module intentionally focuses on **foundational data concepts** rather than complex logic. Control flow and decision-making are introduced later once learners are comfortable working with data.

<h2 align=center>Learning Goals</h2>

By the end of this module, learners should understand:

- What a **variable** is and why variables are necessary
- The difference between **declaring** and **initializing** a variable
- Java's core **primitive data types** (`int`, `double`, `boolean`, `char`) 
- How `String` differs from primitive data types
- How to combine and manipulate text using **String methods**
- How to accept user input using the **Scanner** class
- Why certain input bugs occur and how to fix them
- How data type choice affects program behavior

---

<h2 align=center>Skills You Will Gain</h2>

After completing this module, learners will be able to:

- Declare and initialize variables correctly
- Choose appropriate data types for different kinds of data
- Store, update, and display values in a Java program
- Combine and manipulate text using String operations
- Read user input from the console using Scanner
- Diagnose and fix common input-related bugs
- Build simple interactive console programs

<h2 align=center>Module Summary</h2>

This module marks a major shift in how programs behave. Instead of printing static output, programs now:

- **Store information**
- **Respond to user input**
- **Change based on data**

With a solid understanding of variables, data types, Strings, and input handling, learners are now prepared to begin writing programs that **make decisions**, **repeat actions**, and **model real-world behaviors** in the next modules.
