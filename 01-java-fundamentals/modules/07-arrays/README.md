Module 07: Arrays
</h1>

<h2 align=center>Module Purpose</h2>
The purpose of this module is to teach learners how to store and work with **multiple values** using arrays.

So far, programs have handled one piece of data at a time. Arrays allow programs to store **list of values** and process them efficiently using loops.

Arrays are a fundamental step toward working with larger data sets and more advanced data structures.

<h2 align=center>Learning Goals</h2>

By the end of this module, learners should understand:
- What an array is and why it is useful
- How to declare and create arrays
- How to access elements using an index
- How loops work with arrays
- How to calculate totals and averages from arrays
- How to search for a value inside an array

---

<h2 align=center>Skills You Will Gain</h2>

After completing this module, learners will be able to:
- Store multiple related values in an array
- Use loops to process array data
- Calculate statistics like totals and averages
- Search arrays for specific values
- Combine arrays with logic and conditionals

<h2 align=center>Module Summary</h2>

This module introduced arrays, allowing programs to handle **multiple pieces of data at once**.

You can now:
- Store values in arrays
- Access array elements using indexes
- Loop through arrays to process data
- Calculate totals and averages
- Search arrays using conditional logic.

With arrays mastered, you're ready to learn how to build structured programs using **objects and classes**.
