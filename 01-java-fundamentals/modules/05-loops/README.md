Module 05: Loops
</h1>

<h2 align=center>
Module Purpose
</h2>

The purpose of this module is to teach learners how programs **repeat actions** using loops.

So far, your programs could:
- Store data
- Make decisions
- Validate input

Now, programs will begin to handle **repeated behavior**, like processing multiple values, running game turns, or collecting user input until a condition is met.

Loops are one of the most powerful tools in programming because they allow programs to work with **more than one piece of data** at a time.

Learning Goals
</h2>

By the end of this module, learners should understand:
- How `while` loops repeat as long as a condition is true
- How `for` loops run a set number of times
- How loop control statements (`break`, `continue`) affect loop flow
- How to track totals and extreme values using accumulators
- How nested loops work together
- How loops stop and why infinite loops happen

---

Skills You Will Gain
</h2>

After completing this module, learners will be able to:
- Write programs that process multiple inputs
- Track totals, counts, minimums, and maximums
- Control when loops start and stop
- Build simple repeated gameplay or simulation systems
- Combine loops with conditionals to create dynamic behavior
- Use nested loops to create grid and pattern-based logic

<h2 align=center>Module Summary</h2>

This module taught you how programs repeat actions and process multiple pieces of data.

You can now:
- Use `while` loops for condition-based repetition
- Use `for` loops for count-based repetition
- Control loop flow with `break` and `continue`
- Track totals and extreme values using accumulators
- Use nested loops to generate patterns and grids

With loops mastered, you're ready to learn how to organize repeated logic into **methods** in the next module.
