<h1 align="center">Module 11: Formatting & Output</h1>

<h2 align="center">Module Purpose</h2>

The purpose of this module is to teach learners how to display program output in a **clean, readable, and professional format**.

So far, programs have printed information using simple `System.out.println` statements. While this works, the output often looks messy or misaligned — especially when numbers or text lengths vary.

This module introduces **formatted output**, allowing programs to present data clearly, consistently, and in a way that resembles real-world applications.

<h2 align="center">Learning Goals</h2>

By the end of this module, learners should understand:

- What formatted output is  
- How to use `System.out.printf()`  
- How format specifiers like `%d`, `%f`, and `%s` work  
- How to control spacing, alignment, and decimal places  
- How formatting improves readability  

---

<h2 align="center">Skills You Will Gain</h2>

After completing this module, learners will be able to:

- Format numbers and text using `printf`  
- Align columns of data  
- Control decimal precision  
- Create professional-looking console reports

<h2 align="center">Module Summary</h2>

This module introduced formatted output using `printf`.

You can now:

- Align text and numbers in columns  
- Format decimal values to a specific precision  
- Create clean, readable console reports  

With formatting mastered, you're ready to bring everything together in the **final capstone project**, where all course concepts combine into a full program.
