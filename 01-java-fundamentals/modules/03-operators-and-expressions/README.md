<h1 align=center>Module 03: Operators & Expressions</h1>

<h2 align=center>Module Purpose</h2>

The purpose of this module is to teach learners how Java performs calculations and comparisons using **operators**.

So far, your program can store data (variables), work with text (Strings),  and accept input (Scanner). Now you will learn how to **transform data** using arithmetic, update values efficiently using compound operators, and make **true/false comparisons** using relational and logical operators.

This module focuses on expressions and evaluation — building the foundation needed for decision-making (`if`) and loops in upcoming modules.

---

<h2 align=center>Learning Goals</h2>

By the end of this module, learners should understand:
- How arithmetic operators work: `+ - * / %`
- The difference between **integer division** and **double division**
- How assignment and compound operators update values `= += -= *= /=`
- How increment/decrement work: `++` and `--`
- How relational operators produce boolean results: `== != > < >= <=`
- How to combine conditions using logical operators: `&& || !`
- How to read and write expressions correctly

---

<h2 align=center>Skills You Will Gain</h2>

After completing this module, learners will be able to:
- Build arithmetic expressions to calculate totals, averages, and remainders
- Choose the correct numeric types to avoid unintended truncation
- Update variables efficiently across multiple steps
- Create boolean expressions that compare values
- Combine multiple conditions into a single logical statement
- Build small rule-based console programs using comparisons

<h2 align=center>Module Summary</h2>

This module taught you how to **compute**, **update**, and **evaluate** data in Java.

You can now:
- Perform arithmetic calculations and understand numeric type behavior
- Update variables cleanly using compound operators
- Write boolean expressions using comparisons and logical operators

With operators and expressions mastered, you're ready to begin writing programs that **make decisions** using `if / else` in the next module.
