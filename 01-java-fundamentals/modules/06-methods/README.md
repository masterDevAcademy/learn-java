Module 06: Methods
</h1>

<h2 align=center>Module Purpose</h2>

The purpose of this module is to teach learners how to **organize code into reusable pieces** using methods.

So far, all program logic has lived inside the `main` method. While this works for small programs, real software is built using many smaller methods that each perform a specific task.

Methods make code:
- Easier to read
- Easier to test
- Easier to reuse
- Easier to maintain

This module introduces how to create, use, and structure methods effectively.

---

<h2 align=center>Learning Goals</h2>

By the end of this module, learners should understand:

- What a method is and why methods are important
- How to define a method with parameters
- How to return values from a method
- The difference between **void methods** and **value-returning methods**
- How variable scope works inside and outside methods
- How multiple methods can work together to build a program
- How to use Java's built-in `Random` class to generate random values

---

<h2 align=center>Skills You Will Gain</h2>
After completing this module, learner will be able to:

- Break a large problem into smaller method-based tasks
- Write methods that accept input through parameters
- Write methods that return results 
- Avoid repeating code by reusing methods
- Understand how local variables differ from variables in other methods
- Use randomness to simulate unpredictable behavior in programs

<h2 align=center>Module Summary</h2>

This module taught you how to organize your programs using **methods**.

You can now:

- Create your own methods to perform specific tasks
- Pass information into methods using parameters
- Return results from methods
- Reuse code instead of rewriting it.
- Understand how variables behave in different scopes
- Use random numbers to add unpredictability to programs

With methods mastered, you're ready to start working with **arrays**, where programs handle multiple values at once.
