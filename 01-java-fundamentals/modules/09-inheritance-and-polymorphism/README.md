Module 09: Inheritance and Polymorphism
</h1>

<h2 align=center>Module Purpose</h2>

The purpose of this module is to teach learners how classes can **build on each other** using inheritance and how objects can behave different using polymorphism.

So far, you've created individual classes. Now, you'll learn how to create **base classes** that share common features and **derived classes** that add their own special behavior.

This allows programs to be more organized, reusable, and scalable.

---

<h2 align=center>Learning Goals</h2>

By the end of this module, learners should understand:

- What inheritance is and how it connects classes 
- How the `extends` keyword creates a subclass
- How subclasses inherit fields and methods
- What method overriding is
- How polymorphism allows different objects to share a common type

---

<h2 align=center>Skills You Will Gain</h2>

After completing this module, learners will be able to:
- Create subclasses from a base class
- Reuse shared behavior through inheritance
- Override methods to customize behavior 
- Treat different object types as a shared parent type
- Build more flexible and organized object-oriented programs

<h2 align=center>Module Summary</h2>

This module introduced inheritance and polymorphism, allowing classes to share structure and behave differently.

You can now:
- Build new classes from existing ones
- Share common features using inheritance
- Override methods to customize behavior
- Use polymorphism to treat different objects as a common type

With inheritance mastered, you're ready to learn about **collections**, where objects can be stored and managed in groups.
