<h1 align=center>Module 04: Decision Making</h1>

<h2 align=center>Module Purpose</h2>

The purpose of this module is to teach learners how to write programs the **make decisions**. 

So far, your programs can store data, accept input, and evaluate boolean expressions. In this module, you'll use those boolean results to control what code runs using `if`, `else if`, and `else`.

By the end of this module, you'll be able to build programs that react differently based on user input and program state — a key skill for real applications and game logic.

<h2 align=center>Learning Goals</h2>

By the end of this module, learners should understand:
- How `if`, `else if` and `else` control program flow
- How conditions are evaluated as `true` or `false`
- How to structure branching logic clearly
- How nested conditionals work and when they are appropriate
- How to validate input using guard clauses and clear error messages

---

<h2 align=center>Skills You Will Gain</h2>

After completing this module, learners will be able to:
- Write branching logic using `if / else if / else`
- Use boolean expressions to control behavior
- Build multi-step rule systems using nested conditionals
- Prevent invalid input from breaking a program
- Print clear feedback messages when inputs are invalid

<h2 align=center>Module Summary</h2>

This module taught you how to control program flow using decision-making.

You can now:
- Branch program behavior using `if / else if / else` 
- Build layered logic with nested conditionals
- Validate input and provide clear user feedback

Next module, you'll use these decision-making skills to handle repeated actions using loops.
