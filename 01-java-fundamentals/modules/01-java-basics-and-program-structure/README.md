<h1 align=center>Module 01: Java Basics and Program Structure</h1>

<h2 align=center>Module Purpose</h2>
The purpose of this module is to introduce learners to **what Java is**, **how Java programs run**, and **how a basic Java program is structured**.

This module focuses on helping beginners understand the *shape* and *execution model* of a Java program before writing real logic. By the end of the module, learners should feel comfortable opening a `.java` file, recognizing required parts, and running a simple Java program that produces output in the console.

This module deliberately avoids programming logic and problem-solving. Instead, it builds a solid mental foundation for how Java works at a high-level and how programmers interact with it.

---

<h2 align=center>Learning Goals</h2>
By the end of this module, learners should understand:

- What Java is and why it is widely used
- The difference between **source code** and a **running program**
- How Java code is compiled and executed at a high level
- The role of the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**
- The purpose of the **JDK** and **JRE**
- The basic structure of a Java program
- How a Java program **starts executing**
- The purpose of the `main` method
- How to display **text output** in the console
- How special characters affect printed output

---

<h2 align=center>Skills You Will Gain</h2>
After completing this module, learners will be able to:

- Run a Java program from the command line or an IDE
- Recognize and explain the parts of a simple Java program
- Create and modify Java programs that print output to the console
- Format console output using spacing and escape characters
- Build small, self-contained console programs

        1. What Java Is &amp; How a Java Program Runs
    </a>
</h3>

#### Lesson Goal
Understand what Java is, how Java programs are executed, and what happens between writing code and seeing output.

#### Concepts Covered
- What Java is (high level overview)
- **JVM** vs **JDK** vs **JRE**
- **Compiling** vs. **running** a program
- `.java` source files vs the `.class` file
- The role of the `main()` method in program execution

#### Not Covered Yet
- Writing program logic
- Variables or data types
- User input
- Control flow (if/loops)
- Object-oriented concepts beyond a basic class

#### Mini Project
Create a program that prints:
- Your name
- The Java version being used
- A short message explaining what Java is

    <a href="./02-program-structure-and-main">
        2. Java Program Structure &amp; <code>main()</code>
    </a>
</h3>

#### Lesson Goal
Learn how a Java program is structured and how its required components fit together.

#### Concepts Covered
- Java classes
- The `public static void main(String[] args)` method
- Curly braces and block structure
- Basic indentation and code formatting
- How Java knows where to start executing

#### Not Covered Yet
- Methods beyond `main`
- Objects and instances
- Access modifiers in depth
- Variables or parameters

    </a>
</h3>

#### Lesson Goal
Learn how to display text output clearly and control formatting in the console.

#### Concepts Covered
- `System.out.print` vs `System.out.println`
- Newlines (`\n`)
- Tabs (`\t`)
- Escaping quotation marks {`\"`}
- Manually formatting output using spacing

#### Not Covered Yet
- String variables or concatenation
- User input
- Formatting libraries
- Loops or conditional output

#### Mini Project
Create a program to print a simple receipt layout with aligned text and spacing using only print statements and escape characters

Module Summary
</h2>

This module established the foundation for all future Java programming.

Instead of focusing on logic or problem-solving, you leaned **how Java programs are structure**, **how they run**, and **how programmers interact with them**. You explored what happens between writing code and seeing output, and you built confident navigating Java source files and program execution.
