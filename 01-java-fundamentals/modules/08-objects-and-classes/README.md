Module 08: Objects and Classes
</h1>

<h2 align=center>Module Purpose</h2>

The purpose of this module is to introduce **object-oriented programming (OOP)** using classes and objects.

So far, your programs have used variables and arrays to store data, and methods to organize logic. Now, we will learn how to combine **data and behavior** into structured units called **objects**.

Objects allow programs to model real-world or game-world entities like players, enemies, items, and more.

This module lays the foundation for writing larger, more organized programs.

<h2 align=center>Learning Goals</h2>

By the end of this module, learners should understand:
- What a class is and how it acts as a blueprint
- What an object is and how it is created
- How to define fields (variables inside a class)
- How to create constructors to initialize objects
- How encapsulation protects data using private fields
- How getters and setters provide controlled access to data

---

<h2 align=center>Skills You Will Gain</h2>

After completing this module, learners will be able to:
- Design simple classes to represent real or game entities
- Create objects from classes
- Use constructors to set up object state
- Access and modify object data using methods
- Apply encapsulation to protect internal data

<h2 align=center>Module Summary</h2>

This module introduced object-oriented programming using classes and objects.

You can now:
- Create your own classes
- Use objects to represent entities
- Initialize objects using constructors
- Protect data using encapsulation
- Access object data through methods

With objects mastered, you're ready to explore **inheritance and polymorphism**, where classes can build on each other and share behavior.
